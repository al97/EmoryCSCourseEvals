# EmoryCSCourseEvals

Welcome!

This was a project I completed for a Database Systems class that I took at Emory. Essentially, we were tasked with creating a course evaluation system that would replace our old system (gathering from scantron forms, and written course evaluations).

We were tasked with building the backend (including database design, creation, and population) and the frontend (dynamic website served through PHP). When I mean database design, I mean we started with an ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram, into the creation of a relational model, into the normalization of a database - the whole works, really.

Details about the assignment itself can be found in finalproject.pdf.

If you're a recruiter, and you're looking for evidence of my ability to use SQL (and understand relational databases as a whole), I would suggest looking at these files:
- 
- Normalization (word document), Schema and Model for design of the database
- all the SQL files for population of the database

If you're looking for the PHP code that serves the dynamic website, check out the numerous PHP files listed.
